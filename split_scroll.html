                They are the short stories of the flesh, can evoke the entire event in a moment-the action, the scent and sound-place you there a second time. It's as if the flesh decides to hold onto what threatens its well-being.They become part of the map marking the pain we've had to endure.If only the heart were so ruthless, willing to document what it lived by branding even those sensitive tissues so information might flow back. It's easy to recall what doesn't heal, more difficult to call back what leavesno mark, what depends on memory to bring forward what's been gone so long. The heart's too gentle. It won't hold before us what we may still need to see.</p><p class="author">&mdash;Daniel Halpern</p></div>

                <div id="Will_text"><p class="willBackground">When I was 14, I broke my arm badly. It was the first day of summer vacation after my freshman year of high school. Skateboarding in a cul-de-sac near my house, I fell and hit my head.  When I woke up I looked down at my forearm underneath me, it was bent in two and bleeding against the asphalt. I was too scared to stand up because I thought the broken part of my arm might just fall off. I didn't realize it at the time, but the reason I was bleeding so much, my bone had come out through the skin on the inside of my forearm.</p>  

                <p class="willBackground">After a few minutes of yelling and screaming, neighbors came out to see what was going on.  Luckily one of them had been a paramedic. He slid a cookie sheet under my arm and helped me stand up.  His wife called 911.  I remember one of the paramedics jokingly asking the other, “gee, do think his arm is broken?” I wore a cast for 4 months, and I couldn’t move the last three fingers on my left hand for almost a year.</p></div>

We were at a picnic at a park in River Falls and my uncle’s friend had a young Boston terrier with them. I bent over to pet the dog and it jumped up and bit me in the lip. I went to the hospital to receive 7 stitches. I can still remember being in the hospital and the doctors trying to put a towel over my face and I would not let them. I remember being a little proud, having the scar, kind of like having a battle scar, especially as a young kid.<br><br><p class="robBackground">Up until about 3 months ago I thought the dog was a pug, so my entire life I have hated pugs because of this incident, turns out it was a Boston terrier...I have 2 Bostons now, ironic? Now, I guess I like pugs and I still love Bostons! Let bygones be bygones huh?</p>

We were on a 2-way road. My coworker was passing another car. A car in front of us also attempted to pass and cut us off, instead of hitting him we ended up in the ditch. <br><p>My head hit the windshield and I was really bleeding a lot, I have permanent pain in my back and neck, I got a concussion also, My sister was in the car also hurt her back.

                I remember the night before I had felt stomach pain, and I just assumed it was an adverse reaction to the burger (back when I ate meat!) I had eaten at Applebee's. I went to school the next day as planned but the pain in my stomach never went away and only got worse. One of my classmates told me to "man up" when halfway through the school day I had started walking like a hunchback because the pain in my gut was growing too extreme. Finally, around 9pm that night, my friend, a nursing major, told me how it sounded like appendicitis. Around 10:30 I told my brother to drive me to the ER where they explained the pain as either appendicitis or gas. Gas! Yeah right. Eventually I was transferred to a more equipped hospital where they gave me my very first transvaginal ultrasound as well as my very first CT! Apparently the liquid they inject makes you feel like you're peeing your pants. Eventually I had the 45-minute surgery and spent a lovely 1.5 days in the pediatric ward with a creepy Big Bird statue outside my door to keep me company.</p>
                <p class="lindsayBackground">I assumed the scar would be obvious and large, but the technology is/was advanced enough where it's barely visible. Also being a healthy weight helps the healing process to make a scar less noticeable. Now I'm just happy that I rid myself of a useless organ that fills with poo and then explodes poo in your body.</p></div>
