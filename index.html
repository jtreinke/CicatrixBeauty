                They are the short stories of the flesh, can evoke the entire event in a moment-the action, the scent and sound-place you there a second time. It's as if the flesh decides to hold onto what threatens its well-being.They become part of the map marking the pain we've had to endure.If only the heart were so ruthless, willing to document what it lived by branding even those sensitive tissues so information might flow back. It's easy to recall what doesn't heal, more difficult to call back what leavesno mark, what depends on memory to bring forward what's been gone so long. The heart's too gentle. It won't hold before us what we may still need to see.</p><p class="author">&mdash;Daniel Halpern</p></div>

I lived in a housing co-op at the time, and was cooking dinner for the whole house (~12-18 people) by myself. I needed to open two cans of tomato paste, but our can opener had just broken. In an attempt to be clever, I used an old meat cleaver (which was pretty bent up and hadn't been used in a very long time) to open the cans. The first can was successful, but the second was less so. I missed the can by about an inch, and sliced into my finger probably about 3-4 mm deep - deep enough that I definitely could have gotten stitches. I decided that I would use super glue to seal the wound instead, to save time, and the scar remains yet today. I suppose this event was a sign that I should try to be less hasty and more cautious in life.</p>

I remember riding up to it, jumping, and landing with one foot on the board, one off. My knee slid across the pavement and ripped through my jeans causing a gash on my knee. I was wearing a tee shirt too, and as I fell on my side I scraped a large scar into my elbow too. Afterwards, I was not too worried other than finding a way to make it stop bleeding. Don't really have any perceptions of it (them) because I have acquired so many of the years.</P>

Which doesn't necessarily effect me, but I was super skinny at the time so they thought it might be making my thyroid hyper active. I had it removed and couldn't speak for a week.</p>

                I was in a car accident when I was age 8. Two larger cars smashed into the smaller car I rode in. My leg was sliced and broken in 2 places & I had to be airlifted to a children's hospital where I stayed for 2 weeks and underwent 6 surgeries, including a skin graft with stitches and staples. My leg had a bone-straightening sticking out of it, which I had to maintain and keep clean for about a month or 2. After my time in the hospital, physical therapy and soccer helped strengthen it and I underwent a speedy recovery. Any time I go through a stressful situation, I look to my scar for it reminds me that I've survived worse things.</p>

                I got my bellybutton scar from having my bellybutton ring pulled out in a soccer game. It really fucking hurt. Then I decided after it healed I should get it re-pierced, which was a big mistake. It just looked stupid and so I took it out. I don't really notice the scar at all anymore, but then again I'm not baring my belly too often.</p>

Skateboarding in a cul-de-sac near my house, I fell and hit my head.  When I woke up I looked down at my forearm underneath me, it was bent in two and bleeding against the asphalt. I was too scared to stand up because I thought the broken part of my arm might just fall off. I didn't realize it at the time, but the reason I was bleeding so much, my bone had come out through the skin on the inside of my forearm.</p>  

                <p class="willBackground">After a few minutes of yelling and screaming, neighbors came out to see what was going on.  Luckily one of them had been a paramedic. He slid a cookie sheet under my arm and helped me stand up.  His wife called 911.  I remember one of the paramedics jokingly asking the other, “gee, do you think his arm is broken?” I wore a cast for 4 months, and I couldn’t move the last three fingers on my left hand for almost a year.</p></div>

We were at a picnic at a park in River Falls and my uncle’s friend had a young Boston terrier with them. I bent over to pet the dog and it jumped up and bit me in the lip. I went to the hospital to receive 7 stitches. I can still remember being in the hospital and the doctors trying to put a towel over my face and I would not let them. I remember being a little proud, having the scar, kind of like having a battle scar, especially as a young kid.<br><br><p class="robBackground">Up until about 3 months ago I thought the dog was a pug, so my entire life I have hated pugs because of this incident, turns out it was a Boston terrier...I have 2 Bostons now, ironic?

                I remember the night before I had felt stomach pain, and I just assumed it was an adverse reaction to the burger (back when I ate meat!) I had eaten at Applebee's. I went to school the next day as planned but the pain in my stomach never went away and only got worse. One of my classmates told me to "man up" when halfway through the school day I had started walking like a hunchback because the pain in my gut was growing too extreme. 
                <p class="lindsayBackground">Finally, around 9pm that night, my friend, a nursing major, told me how it sounded like appendicitis. Around 10:30 I told my brother to drive me to the ER where they explained the pain as either appendicitis or gas. Gas! Yeah right. Eventually I was transferred to a more equipped hospital where they gave me my very first transvaginal ultrasound as well as my very first CT! Apparently the liquid they inject makes you feel like you're peeing your pants. Eventually I had the 45-minute surgery and spent a lovely 1.5 days in the pediatric ward with a creepy Big Bird statue outside my door to keep me company.</p>
                <p class="lindsayBackground">I assumed the scar would be obvious and large, but the technology is/was advanced enough where it's barely visible. Also being a healthy weight helps the healing process to make a scar less noticeable. Now I'm just happy that I rid myself of a useless organ that fills with poo and then explodes poo in your body.</p></div>

                The fall of 1972, I was a passenger in the car my coworker was driving. I was riding shotgun. The car lacked seatbelts. We were going home. We were on a 2-way road. My coworker was passing another car. A car in front of us also attempted to pass and cut us off, instead of hitting him we ended up in the ditch. <br><p class="momBackground">My head hit the windshield and I was really bleeding a lot, I have permanent pain in my back and neck, I got a concussion also, My sister was in the car also hurt her back.

My aunt, who also lived there, had just had a baby and my cousins' family came to visit.I was 7, a very active child who loved jumping all over the place. The house had a little garden where we played the whole day. It was time for them to leave.</p>
                <p class="shoumithBackground">At the gate, someone gave me a flashy gift and that got me so excited. I was walking back with grandma, but was totally concentrated on exploring the flashy item in my hand. As I took a step, I tripped on her leg, tried gaining balance on my next step, but I slipped because of a stupid garden water pipe that was across the walkway&mdash;flew a few yards and landed head first on the edge of the marble stairs.</P>
                <p class="shoumithBackground">Next thing I know, I wake up with my blood soaked t-shirt to a doctor stitching his way through my head, 8 on the muscle and 8 on my skin. Apparently my skull was visible. I screamed and moved so much that the doc ended up doing a poor job with the stitches. My mom saw my that evening and almost fainted from shock. I totally blamed my grandma for her being old and not careful with me.16 years later, I can still see the messy scar, which still reminds me of that scary fall. Such a nightmare.<br>The end.</p>

                <div id="mara_text"><p class="maraBackground">The scar on my left palm is from a biking accident I had in 1996, when I was 5.  I had just learned to ride a bike without training wheels and was biking back home from a park with my parents.  All was going well until we started to go down a “hill” – I say “hill” because in my memory it is a huge, mountainous landform, but have realized since revisiting it that the hill is so comically small that it is hard to imagine anyone losing control on it, even a five-year-old.  But when we started to go down the hill, I hit some gravel, skidded, and fell off my bike onto the side of the road.</p><p class="maraBackground">I ended up catching my fall with my left hand, and got cut on the palm of my hand. A lot of dirt got into the cut, but I refused to let my parents clean it very well because the antiseptic stung. Now, there is a fairly dark line about half an inch long on my palm.  I remember going to the doctor shortly after it happened, and the doctor said that it was a “permanent tattoo” because the dirt was stuck in the wound.  Even though the scar would not be nearly as noticeable now if I had allowed it to be cleaned well, I’ve grown rather fond of my “tattoo” over the years.  It, and other scars I have, have served as reminders of past life experiences and lessons learned.</p>

                <div id="roxie_text"><p class="roxieBackground">I had hip surgery when I was 16 in 2000, then again a year later to have the hip pin removed (which was only partially successful- I still have a pin and two screws in my hip, though they did remove the plate). I had a cyst growing in my femur, right near the top. Eventually my bone became eggshell thin and cracked. This obviously was emotionally stressful for a 16 year old. I had to give up my varsity volleyball and softball positions. I was super self conscious about the scar, but luckily it wasn't somewhere super visible- just annoying at the pool, where you were already self-conscious anyway in front of scantily clad teens.</p>
                <p class="roxieBackground">
                I think the scar itself was motivation in me getting my first tattoo a few months later when I turned 18. I was so angry about having this ugly 7-inch scar on my body that I wanted to have something that I put there intentionally. Now, I think it's kind of badass. A war wound. My hip doesn't bother me and I'm insanely lucky the tumor wasn't cancerous. The surgeries themselves brought me much closer to my mom (I was a daddy's girl at the time) but my mom was the nurturer. Now my mom and I are great friends, and I do think that I have the surgeries partially to thank for that.</p>

There were about 7 of 4 boys, 3 girls and us. It was the middle of winter in Wisconsin and we all rolled out of the hot tub to go inside when I drunkenly reached for a box of cereal and slipped on the wet floor of his parent’s kitchen and hit the corner of my eye on the ground.</P><p class="sarahAckermanBackground"> I’m not going to lie, I don’t remember a whole lot around the immediate feeling but when I woke up the next morning in my bed the pain of the cut/gash was not only excruciating but so were the memories, or lack thereof, from the events that occurred the night before. Now, I have a friendly reminder permanently, subtly on my face of some not so brilliant things I did in my early 20’s.</p>

I was running around like any responsible 8 year old should, when he faked to throw something at me. I dove out of the way and proceeded to nail the corner of a side table next to the couch. At that point I was seeing red (as blood was streaming into my vision) and (hopefully understandably) screaming in fright more than pain.</P>
                <p class="kevinBackground">Luckily, my mom wasn't working that day and promptly took me to the ER for some stitches, followed by taking me to Blockbuster Video to rent a Ninja Turtles Nintendo game (yes I'm that old). That made for some actually kind of fond memories of the experience. Yet, whenever I consider the scar itself I think about the fact that had I hit less than an inch further to the right, I probably would have lost my left eye, or at least suffered some severe vision loss.</p>
